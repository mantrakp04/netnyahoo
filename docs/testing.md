# Testing

`pnpm test` at the root runs every unit test (82 cases). Turbo caches the results; a cold run spends most
of its time in `swift test`'s first build. Each package also runs its own:

| Package | Command | Cases |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apps/browser` | `pnpm --filter @netnyahoo/browser test` | 49 |
| `packages/core` | `pnpm --filter @netnyahoo/core test` | 14 |
| `packages/sync` | `pnpm --filter @netnyahoo/sync test` (`swift test`, then `node --test`) | 5 + 8 |
| `packages/import` | `pnpm --filter @netnyahoo/import test` (`swift test`) | 5 |
| `extras/raycast-netnyahoo` | `node --test extras/raycast-netnyahoo/src/scripts.test.ts` | 1 |

`apps/browser` runs its TypeScript under plain Node: `src/test-loader.mjs` maps `@netnyahoo/shell`,
`@netnyahoo/nncore` and `expo-modules-core` to `src/test-native-stub.mjs`. One file:
`node --no-warnings --import ./src/test-loader.mjs --test src/store/tabs.test.mjs` (from `apps/browser`).

End-to-end checks need a built app and are run by hand:

| Check | Run | Guards |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Release smoke test | `.claude/skills/release/scripts/smoke.sh` (the `release` skill) | Every release, whole |
| Shortcuts | `node apps/browser/scripts/shortcuts-test.mjs <Debug app>` | Every shortcut in every focus (0.2.8: ⌘1–9 were swallowed outside a page) |
| Profile swipes | `node apps/browser/scripts/profile-swipe-test.mjs <Debug app>` | The native pager's races (0.2.14–0.2.18 fixes) |
| ⌘-scroll | `node apps/browser/scripts/zoom-scroll-test.mjs <Debug app>` | Trackpad scrolls, mouse zooms (regressed in 0.1.4 and 0.2.12) |
| Sync | `node packages/sync/scripts/e2e.mjs <Debug app>` | Two and three hidden instances through one folder (`docs/sync.md`) |
| Engine patches | `python3 engine/patches/series.py check` | The patch series reproduces the Chromium tree (`docs/cef-source-build.md`) |
| Engine (NNCore) | `node packages/nncore/scripts/acceptance.mjs <Debug app> <scratch dir>` | The app on NNCore, hidden (`docs/nncore-parity.md`) |

## What's kept, and why

The suite was cut from 412 unit cases to 82 on 2026-10-01. A case stays when breaking what it guards would
lose or leak data, or when the bug is invisible by eye and has shipped before.

| File | Kept | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apps/browser/src/store/privacy.test.mjs` | Private windows and incognito: nothing in `session.json`, `downloads.json` or favicon files, no history, no closed-tab records, no dragging tabs across; history time-range clearing; profile deletion queues Chrome's data and keeps shared data | Privacy and data loss. 0.2.11 shipped private tabs saved to disk and a deleted profile's data left behind |
| `apps/browser/src/store/session.test.mjs` | v1 → v2 migration; `hydrate` repairing a damaged session; reopened windows keeping back/forward (0.2.12); shared profile data across a reload; `history.json`'s hand-written serializer; pinned tabs unloading on ⌘W, parking with a closed window, coming back once, surviving a relaunch (0.2.2, 0.2.8) | Session and history persistence |
| `apps/browser/src/store/tabs.test.mjs` | Opener placement and close → activate rules; group contiguity; broken splits dropped; clean-up and abandoned New Tab cleanup never closing a window or the shown tab; Chrome's echo of the app's own tab switch; an extension's default search engine; the mini player staying closed (0.2.12) | Core behaviour that's hard to see by eye |
| `apps/browser/src/components/omnibox/inline.test.mjs` | Every interleaving of typing and inline completion; stale completions never applied | 0.1.6: fast typing dropped or reordered letters |
| `apps/browser/src/sync/adapters.test.mjs`, `engine.test.mjs` | Bookmark delete-vs-add and move cycles, parked pinned tabs, passwords (newest wins); a crash right after a batch lands; nothing published before its journal is on disk | Sync data loss (0.2.11) |
| `apps/browser/src/telemetry/sanitize.test.mjs` | URLs, hosts, paths, user names, quoted text, emails, dev hosts and NSException reasons never leave the Mac | Privacy: telemetry must never carry what the user browsed |
| `packages/core/src/url.test.ts` | Typed text → URL (`resolveInput`, `fixupUrl`); IDN homograph spoofing stays punycode; tracking parameters stripped without touching the rest; `netnyahoo://` shown, never `chrome://` | URL parsing and security |
| `packages/core/src/suggest.test.ts` | Inline completion never fills a long sign-in URL; free text never autocompletes; open tabs switchable; frecency ranking; a newer fetch aborts the older one | Omnibox ranking |
| `packages/sync` | The 8 convergence cases above, and the crypto's 5 (`docs/sync.md` › Tests) | Sync correctness and encryption |
| `packages/import/tests/ImportTests.swift` | Importing never writes to the source profile, never leaves its data folder, decrypts logins only with the right key and only after consent | Another browser's data and secrets |
| `extras/raycast-netnyahoo` | Ids are quoted in the AppleScript it sends | Script injection |

## What went, and why

| Removed | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Spring, rubber-band, capsule and layout constants (`swipeMotion`, `stripGroups`), group naming and labels, numbered tabs, release-note postcard timing, favicon index bounds | Pin exact constants or formatting; a visual check catches these |
| Calculator, quick-create commands, Tab-to-search, text fragments, custom engine validation, most `appUrls` cases | Small pure helpers whose failure is visible the moment you use them |
| Live folders (GitHub, Meetings), Small Yahu, splits beyond integrity, organize beyond clean-up, OTLP encoding | Feature detail rather than data or security; covered by use |
| The rest of `pinnedClose`, `openers`, `idn`, `suggest`, `sanitize`, sync and import | Variations of a kept case |
| `profile-pager-race-test.mjs` | Loaded the pager's source with its dependencies mocked; `profile-swipe-test.mjs` runs the same races against the real app |
| `profile-motion-stall-test.mjs`, `profile-swipe-replay.mjs` (and the owner's trackpad recording) | One-off investigation harnesses for the native pager, done in 0.2.18 |
| `packages/import/src/index.test.ts`, Swift tests for Dia tabs, file imports, Firefox and Chromium parsing | The JS wrapper is a thin bridge; parsing failures show in the importer's own result |
