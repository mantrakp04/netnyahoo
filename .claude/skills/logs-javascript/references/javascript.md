# JavaScript web Logs installation

The PostHog JavaScript web SDK ships with first-class support for Logs. Send structured log records with the `posthog.logger` API or opt in to autocapture of `console.*` calls.

> **Minimum version:** `posthog-js@1.368.0` or later. Run `npm update posthog-js` (or your package manager's equivalent) to update.

1.  1

    ## Install posthog-js

    Required

    If you haven't already, install `posthog-js` using your package manager:

    ### npm

    ```bash
    npm install --save posthog-js
    ```

    ### Yarn

    ```bash
    yarn add posthog-js
    ```

    ### pnpm

    ```bash
    pnpm add posthog-js
    ```

    ### Bun

    ```bash
    bun add posthog-js
    ```

    > **If your site sets a Content-Security-Policy**, it needs to allow PostHog. This applies to the snippet and to package installs alike: the SDK lazy-loads extra bundles (session replay, surveys) from PostHog's CDN, and sends events to the ingestion host. PostHog serves from subdomains of `posthog.com` that change over time, so allow the wildcard:
    >
    > ```
    > script-src 'self' https://*.posthog.com;
    > connect-src 'self' https://*.posthog.com;
    > worker-src 'self' blob: data:;
    > ```
    >
    > `script-src` covers the snippet and the lazy-loaded bundles, `connect-src` covers event ingestion and feature flags, and `worker-src` covers session replay. The [toolbar needs a few more](/docs/advanced/content-security-policy.md), or use a [reverse proxy](/docs/advanced/proxy.md) so everything is first-party. Failing to do so causes silent failures where `capture` and `identify` calls never send, so the integration looks complete while zero events arrive. Remember `connect-src` falls back to `default-src`, so `default-src 'self'` blocks event delivery even when the script itself is bundled.

    ## Configure logs at init

    Required

    Set your service identity in `posthog.init`. These fields map to standard [OpenTelemetry resource attributes](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/) and apply to every log record this client sends.

    Web

    ```javascript
    import posthog from 'posthog-js'
    
    posthog.init('<ph_project_token>', {
      api_host: 'https://us.i.posthog.com',
      defaults: '2026-05-30',
      logs: {
        serviceName: 'checkout-web',
        environment: 'production',
        serviceVersion: '1.2.3',
      },
    })
    ```

    | Option | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | `serviceName` | Identifies the app in the Logs UI. Maps to the OpenTelemetry `service.name` resource attribute. Defaults to `'unknown_service'`. |
    | `environment` | Deployment environment, e.g. `'production'` or `'staging'`. Maps to `deployment.environment`. |
    | `serviceVersion` | Release version, e.g. `'1.2.3'`. Maps to `service.version`. |
    | `resourceAttributes` | Additional OpenTelemetry resource attributes, e.g. `{ 'host.name': 'web-01' }`. |
    | `flushIntervalMs` | How often batched log records are flushed. Defaults to `3000`. |
    | `maxBufferSize` | Buffer size before forcing a flush. Defaults to `100`. |
    | `maxLogsPerInterval` | Rate limit per flush window. Excess records are dropped with a single warning. Defaults to `1000`. |

    See the [web SDK config reference](/docs/libraries/js/config.md#configuring-logs) for the complete list.

    ## Send structured logs with posthog.logger

    Recommended

    `posthog.logger` is the declarative path. Each call produces an OTLP log record with a severity level and typed attributes you can filter and query on in the Logs product.

    Web

    ```javascript
    posthog.logger.info('checkout completed', { order_id: 'ord_789', total_cents: 4200 })
    posthog.logger.warn('payment retry', { attempt: 2, gateway: 'stripe' })
    posthog.logger.error('payment failed', { error_code: 'E001', order_id: 'ord_789' })
    ```

    Available severity levels: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal`.

    Logger calls don't write to the browser console, they go directly to PostHog as structured records. You can query logs by attribute, such as `total_cents > 1000`, instead of string-searching log output. Nothing extra appears in the user's browser console.

    For full control over a log record, including trace correlation, use `posthog.captureLog`:

    Web

    ```javascript
    posthog.captureLog({
      body: 'checkout completed',
      level: 'info',
      attributes: { order_id: 'ord_789', tags: ['checkout', 'v2'] },
      trace_id: '0af7651916cd43dd8448eb211c80319c', // optional, 32 hex chars
      span_id: 'b7ad6b7169203331',                   // optional, 16 hex chars
    })
    ```

    Attribute values can be strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or plain objects. `null` and `undefined` values are dropped.

    ## Autocapture console logs

    Optional

    To forward `console.log`, `console.warn`, `console.error`, and friends without changing your code, set `logs.captureConsoleLogs: true`.

    Web

    ```javascript
    posthog.init('<ph_project_token>', {
      api_host: 'https://us.i.posthog.com',
      defaults: '2026-05-30',
      logs: {
        captureConsoleLogs: true,
        serviceName: 'checkout-web',
      },
    })
    ```

    > **Warning:** Overriding a system library like `console` has a large blast radius. Everything your app or its dependencies write to the console gets forwarded to PostHog, including:
    >
    > -   Debug output referencing passwords, tokens, API keys, or session identifiers
    > -   Stack traces containing user input
    > -   Third-party library chatter you don't control
    >
    > This can breach data privacy compliance and is difficult to clean up. Before turning it on:
    >
    > 1.  Audit what your app and its dependencies currently log.
    > 2.  Get sign-off from anyone in your organization whose code runs in the browser.
    > 3.  Prefer `posthog.logger` for anything you actually care about – it's structured, queryable, and doesn't pull in unrelated output.

    `posthog.logger` and `captureConsoleLogs` are independent and can be enabled together. The logger path emits OTLP records directly; the autocapture path scrapes console strings.

    ### Two ways to turn it on

    Console autocapture is enabled by either of two independent switches:

    -   `logs.captureConsoleLogs: true` in `posthog.init()`, as above.
    -   **Capture console logs** under Logs in [project settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings/project), which reaches the SDK through remote config.

    Either one turns it on, and neither switches the other off. If you enabled it in `init()`, turning the project setting off does not stop capture – remove the option from your code instead.

    ### Early console calls

    The `console` wrappers that forward records to PostHog live in a script the SDK loads lazily, so calls made during page startup would otherwise be missed. This matters most for framework output that only ever appears early, like React hydration warnings.

    From posthog-js **1.422.0**, the SDK records `console.*` calls into a small in-memory buffer while that script loads, then backfills them once it is ready. Each buffered record keeps the timestamp and person it had at the moment of the call, so backfilled entries appear in order rather than bunched at load time.

    How much of startup is covered depends on how you enabled capture:

    -   **`captureConsoleLogs` in `init()`** – covered from `posthog.init()` onwards, on every page load.
    -   **Project setting only** – covered from `posthog.init()` on repeat visits, but on a visitor's very first page load capture starts when remote config responds, so calls before that are missed.

    Set the `init()` option if you need the full startup window covered on the first load too.

    The buffer holds up to `logs.maxBufferSize` records (100 by default), keeping the earliest ones, and is discarded without sending if capture turns out to be disabled, the user opts out, or you call `posthog.reset()`.

    Arguments are buffered by reference. If you log an object and then mutate it before the script finishes loading, the backfilled record shows the mutated value.

    ## Link logs to sessions and users

    Recommended

    When `posthog-js` is initialized, the web SDK automatically attaches the current `distinct_id` and `session_id` to every log record. Log entries appear linked to the matching [Session Replay](/docs/session-replay.md) and person without any extra setup.

    See [Link Session Replay](/docs/logs/link-session-replay.md) for how this surfaces in the UI, and how to do the equivalent from server-side SDKs.

    ## Test your setup

    Recommended

    Once everything is configured, verify log records are flowing:

    1.  Call `posthog.logger.info('hello from posthog-js')` somewhere your page executes.
    2.  Open the [Logs](https://app.posthog.com/logs) interface and filter by the `serviceName` you set above.
    3.  Confirm the record shows up with the attributes you sent.
